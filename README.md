ARPSync for Home Assistant

ARPSync is a Home Assistant add-on designed to automatically synchronize ARP records from your home modem into Home Assistant. This helps keep your device presence data accurate, especially for network-based automations and presence detection.

The add-on is built with a modular architecture to support multiple modem types. In this initial release, it supports Viettel modems, with additional vendors planned for future updates.

To enable secure access to the modem, you will need to configure your modem’s login credentials (username and password) in the add-on settings.

Keep your Home Assistant network data fresh and reliable—without any manual polling or scripting.
